# NEURAL-NETWORK-FROM-SCRATCH
A dream of every coder, to create your own Neural Network by yourselves. I lived mine. 

This is an implementation of a Neural Network from scratch, with only numpy used. Other functions including optimizer is implemented. 
All the utility functions are in utils file.

I learnt everything from a pdf I got generated from perplexity. It covers all the theory. Attached. 

The model was used on a dataset of wines with their chemical composition and a quality index (1-10) given. The dataset of ~12000 entries is attached as well. 

The network was initialised with 4 layers, with first three having ReLu as activating function.

I was trained for 100 epochs, with a learning-rate of 0.001. Accuracy achieved - 91.19%
